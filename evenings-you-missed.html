                In lieu of a spring performance, the Columbia Ballet Collaborative commissioned Fergus Campbell and the choreographer Sarah Marazzi-Sassoon to produce a short film. Rehearsals for what became “Evenings You Missed” began in January 2021, and scenes were shot in April, following distancing guidelines, on Columbia’s campus, the Upper West Side, and in Boston. “Evenings You Missed” imagines—and heightens—the feelings of interacting with other people, while gathering for a meal, or getting home late, or growing upset. Christine Blackshaw, the piece’s “narrator,” holds the fragments together, moving through a kind of liminal space, allowing the viewer in and, ultimately, asking them to leave.
