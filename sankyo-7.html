                Raf Khalilov and Jane Paknia composed Episode Seven’s original music, with Paknia responsible for the two synth-heavy pieces that score Lyla Trilling and Isabel Gilmour’s original sequence, as well as the central interview segment; and Khalilov behind the piano theme heard whenever the episode’s fate-conscious bums turn up. Paknia’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1lilRp0uIodHp4RNNwvjSn\">Spotify</a> overflows with sonic novelties; you can find out about upcoming gigs on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/janepakniamusic/?hl=en">Instagram</a>.
