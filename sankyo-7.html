                Contrary to popular belief, Sankyo did not happen upon Jesse Newman and Justin Scheer in a random park in Bushwick—Newman is a high school friend and recent New York transplant—but the skaters proved natural screen presences. Newman has also recently forayed into modeling.

                Lyla Trilling and Isabel Gilmour made their Sankyo Stream debut as writers with Episode Seven (Gilmour previously performed in Episode Three), but both are avid creators at Columbia University. They’ve each contributed to The Blue and White, Columbia’s beloved undergraduate magazine; Gilmour’s short story “Jean Luc and I” and Trilling’s profile of The Cut columnist Brock Colyar are recent highlights. Trilling also serves as one of the magazine’s senior editors.

                Raf Khalilov and Jane Paknia composed Episode Seven’s original music, with Paknia responsible for the two synth-heavy pieces that score Lyla Trilling and Isabel Gilmour’s original sequence, as well as the central interview segment; and Khalilov behind the piano theme heard whenever the episode’s fate-conscious bums turn up. Paknia’s Spotify overflows with sonic novelties; you can find out about upcoming gigs on Instagram. So far, Khalilov’s published music is mostly exclusive to Sankyo Stream.
